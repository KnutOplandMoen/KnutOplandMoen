| **[Tic-Tac-Toe-computervision-robot](https://github.com/KnutOplandMoen/Tic-Tac-Toe-computervision-robot)** | A fully autonomous robot that uses computer vision, AI, and robotics to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a human opponent. The robot "sees" the board, "thinks" of a move, and executes it. | `C++` `Python`       |
| **[Ai-text-detector](https://github.com/KnutOplandMoen/Ai-text-detector)**                               | A neural network designed to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text.                                | `Python`     |
| **[light_NN](https://github.com/KnutOplandMoen/light_NN)**                                               | A neural network framework for supervised and Q-learning, built from scratch in C++ as part of a university course project.                                                       | `C++`    |
